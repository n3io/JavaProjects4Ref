Overview

The professional programmer’s Deitel® video guide to Java™ SE 8 and SE 9 development with the powerful Java™ platform

Description

Written for programmers with a background in high-level language programming, this LiveLesson applies the Deitel signature live-code approach to teaching programming and explores the Java™ language and Java™ APIs in depth. The LiveLesson presents concepts in the context of fully tested programs, not code fragments. The LiveLesson features hundreds of complete Java™ programs with thousands of lines of proven Java™ code, and hundreds of tips that will help you build robust applications.

Skill Level

Beginner-to-Intermediate

What you Will Learn

Start with an introduction to Java™ using an early classes and objects approach, then rapidly move on to more advanced topics, including GUI, graphics, exception handling, lambdas, streams, functional interfaces, object serialization, concurrency, generics, generic collections, JDBC™ and more. You’ll enjoy Deitels’ classic treatment of object-oriented programming and the object-oriented design ATM case study, including a complete Java™ implementation. And new to this LiveLesson is detailed coverage of JShell, Java 9’s REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) for interactive Java. When you’re finished, you’ll have everything you need to build industrial-strength object-oriented Java applications.

Practical, Example-Rich Coverage of:
Java™ SE 8 and SE 9
JShell, Java 9’s REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) for interactive Java
Lambdas, Streams, Functional Interfaces with Default and Static Methods
Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces
Swing and JavaFX GUIs; Graphics
Integrated Exception Handling
Files, Streams, Object Serialization
Multithreading and Concurrency for Optimal Multi-Core Performance
Generics and Generic Collections
Database (JDBC™, SQL and JavaDB)
Using the Debugger and the API Docs
Industrial-Strength, Object-Oriented Design ATM Case Study and more.
Introducing the Java Platform Module System (JPMS)—Java 9’s most important new software-engineering technology. Modularity—the result of Project Jigsaw—helps developers at all levels be more productive as they build, maintain and evolve software systems, especially large systems. The key goals of JPMS include: reliable configuration, strong encapsulation, scalable Java Platform, greater platform integrity, and improved performance.

JShell is one of Java’s most significant new learning, discovery and developer-productivity-enhancement features since Java’s inception 20+ years ago. JShell—Java’s REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) provides a fast and friendly environment that enables you to interactively explore, discover and experiment with Java language features and its extensive libraries.
